# PicoSerialCom
This project is a private node package for a simple communication with the Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico W boards. I includes a warpper for the serialport client with many prewritten scripts and other helpers.

> This projects main/initial purpose is to offload the communication core and utilities from the [Pico-W-Go repo](https://github.com/paulober/Pico-W-Go) into a seperate repository for development and usability reasons. Also it is/was meant to replace the old ugly asynchronous mess of a communication piece to allow the developement of new complex features.
